I love watching Anime and reading Manga and one my most favorite Anim/Manga is "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken" or in english term "That Time I Got Reincarnted as a slime" In order for you all to know what I'm talking about I created this website where you can watch my favorite anime and read my favorite manga as well. <p class="h">For more info visit my:</p> </p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/iban.carino"><p class="h">Facebook Profile</p></a><a href="https://accounts.google.com/SignOutOptions?hl=en&continue=https://mail.google.com/mail&service=mail"><p class="h">Email Address</p></a><a href="https://www.instagram.com/iban0109/"><p class="h">Instagram Profile</p></a></div>
		<div class="c"><h1 class="f">About the Anime:</h1><p>When thirty-seven-year-old Satoru Mikami gets stabbed saving his friend, he hears a voice granting him requests for his next lifeâ€”only to wake up in a new incarnation as a particularly overpowered slime. After befriending a dragon and learning how to manifest his awesome new powers, Satoru, now going by Rimuru Tempest, finds himself hailed as one of the strongest monsters around. How best to use his new powers? By teaching a tribe of goblins infrastructure and government, of course!	</p><p>That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime's first novel feels a bit like the child of So I'm a Spider, So What? and How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom. Its protagonist, known for most of the book as Rimuru, is a contractor reborn into a fantasy world as a grossly overpowered slime. He quickly learns skills that belie his outward appearance as the weakest of all monsters and rises to the top of the monster food chain. His first order of business turns out to be rescuing a dragon, but after that, he turns his powers to the much more prosaic task of helping a band of goblins learn how to build, farm, and install septic systems. While not as fun as So I'm a Spider, So What? or as bureaucratic as How a Realist Hero Rebuilt the Kingdom, it's certainly an interesting story that uses the genre mashup to its own benefit</p>
