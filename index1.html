After meeting him and his partner Miho on the street, he is stabbed to death by a passing robber (incredibly brutal death). After making some requests during his death, he is reincarnated in another world as a slime with the ability known as predator (which can devour other creatures and obtain their abilities). Upon making friends with the dragon Veldora, the slime, now known as Rimuru Tempest, embarks on a journey to find a way to free Veldora from his seal, encountering many different races along the way (along with embarking on side quests throughout the story).</p></div>
